# READ-1-BTEC : APIs and SDK

## API (Application Programming Interface):

Software development and innovation are made simpler by APIs or application interfaces, which allow applications to communicate information and functionality rapidly and securely.

## Types of APIs:

### 1. Public APIs:

Publicly accessible APIs. A public API is accessible and available by any external developer or corporation. A business strategy that includes sharing your applications and data with other firms will be developed and offered to a public API.
Authentication and permission in public APIs are typically modest. An organization can also try to monetize the API by charging the public API with a per call charge.

### 2. Partner APIs:

Partner APIs are sold freely but only with partners signing an agreement with the editor. For partner APIs, software integration between two firms is a common usage case. A company providing data or skills to its partners may develop additional cash streams. At the same time, it can measure the utilization of the exposed digital assets, provide a pleasant user experience and ensure corporate identity in your apps is preserved by third-party solutions using your APIs.

### 3. Internal APIs:

An private (internal) API is meant to connect the company's systems and data. For example, an internal API can connect the payroll and HR systems of a business. Since internal APIs are for internal use and such safety requirements are supposed to be implemented by means of other regulations, they are often unsafe and authenticated â€” or not at all. However, this change is caused by an increased awareness of risks and regulatory compliance requirements in the API Strategies of the businesses.

### 4. Composite APIs:

Developers can access many endpoints with composite APIs in a single call. It might be several services or source data, or distinct API endpoints. In microservice architectures, Composite APIs are especially useful, because a user might require data from several services to accomplish a single task. Since a call might return all data needed by a user, composite APIs can decrease server load and performance.

## The benefits of using APIs for developers:

### 1. Automation:

APIs allow computers instead of separate jobs to handle. Agencies may make workflows more efficient and productive by using APIs.

### 2. Flexibility:

An API is used to build an app layer that can be utilized for dissemination and adapted to give a unique user experience with information and services to new audiences.

### 3. Personalization:

APIs enable every user and company to customise the most commonly consumed material and services.

### 4. Integration:

APIs enable the incorporation of information from any website or application. This guarantees the fluidity of the information and the integration of user experience.

### 5. Efficiency:

The produced material may be published and made accessible instantaneously on all channels when an API is accessible. It makes sharing and distributing easy.

## Comparing between APIs and SDK:

API and SDK are frequently misinterpreted two concepts in software development. API means "Application Program Interface" and refers to guidelines and standards for programming to connect with websites or databases. For instance, a software company can often make its API publicly or privately accessible to other software developers to create products that leverage the service. An API can be included with an SDK or Software Development Kit. An SDK is a set of tools to produce software that you may build applications for a certain platform. SDKs contain one or more APIs and developing tools and documentation. Take a look at the Java SDK, comprising an API, compilers, runtimes and other tools.

An API is a library collection that is core language and can be used immediately, whereas an SDK is a development kit that simplifies the usage of an API. In principle, both are means to communicate with the resources of another part of the software and to manage them.

An API is therefore nothing more than an interface to a service, whereas an SDK is a tool or a component collection for a certain purpose. In actuality, an SDK has an API to interact with, although you may use an API without the basic components, for example, when the API is provided via a web service.
